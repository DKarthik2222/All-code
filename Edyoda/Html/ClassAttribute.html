        <p class="planet-desc">This may sound surprising given that the planet is so close to the Sun, 
            but the ice is in permanently shadowed craters that don't receive any sunlight.
            Organics, a building block for life, were also found on the planet's surface. 
            While Mercury doesn't have enough atmosphere and is too hot for life as we know it, 
            finding organics there demonstrates how those compounds were distributed throughout the solar system. </p>

        <p class="planet-desc">Earth, third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the solar system in terms of size and mass. 
            Its single most outstanding feature is that its near-surface environments are the only places in the universe known to harbour life. 
            It is designated by the symbol ♁. Earth’s name in English, the international language of astronomy, 
            derives from Old English and Germanic words for ground and earth, 
            and it is the only name for a planet of the solar system that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology.</p>

        <p class="planet-desc">The body of water appears similar to underground lakes found on Earth in Greenland and Antarctica. 
            On Earth, microbial life persists down in the dark, frigid waters of one such lake. 
            The ice on Mars would also shield the Martian lake from the damaging radiation that bombards the planet’s surface.</p>
